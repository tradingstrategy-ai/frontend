# Trading Strategy protocol website

A frontend for [Trading Strategy protocol](https://tradingstrategy.ai).

## Install NPM dependencies

Node >=20.19 required.

### Setup pnpm

```shell
# Enable pnpm via corepack (recommended)
corepack enable

# Verify installation
pnpm --version
```

### Install dependencies

```shell
pnpm install
```

## Install and build submodules

`frontend` has one submodule dependency installed under `deps`:

- `fonts` - optional licensed fonts (see `static/fonts5.css` and `src/lib/components/css/typography.css`)

### Install submodules

If you have access to the private `tradingstrategy-ai/fonts`, initialize and install submodules:

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Building submodule dependencies

Once the submodule has been installed, a build step needs to be run in order to have a fully
working environment. Run the following script:

```shell
bash scripts/build-deps.sh
```

## Running in local dev

Environment variables required by the app are maintained in a `.env` file. Read about about
[magic VITE envs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68479217/how-to-load-environment-variables-in-svelte).

Start the SvelteKit development server:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

## Notes

### Code Formatting Standards

We are using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. Extensions are available for
most code editors / IDEs (see "Editor Support" on Prettier homepage).

If you prefer not to have your editor do automatic formatting, please run the following command and
commit properly formatted code before pushing a PR:

```shell
pnpm run format
```

Our CI/CD pipeline runs the following chack on PRs or pushes to `master`:

```shell
pnpm run format:check
```

### `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`

[`adapter-node` will bundle `devDependencies`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-node#deploying) whereas `dependencies` must be installed when deploying to production.
