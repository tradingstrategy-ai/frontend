TRADING STRATEGY 
A Next Generation Algorithmic Trading Protocol for Decentralised Markets


Terms of Use


As part of our ongoing commitment to comply with all legal regulations, we restrict IP addresses located in certain jurisdictions from accessing our website and application’s frontend user interface. These jurisdictions include, but are not limited to: United States, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Russia. We reserve the right to modify this list at any point in time, without notice. Any use of software, including, but not limited to, virtual private networks (“VPN”) is in direct violation of these terms of use.


TRADING STRATEGY IS A PORTFOLIO OF EXPERIMENTAL BLOCKCHAIN-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGIES AND TECHNICAL FUNCTIONALITIES ONLY. USING THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND FUNCTIONALITIES (INCLUDING VIA THE INTERFACE ON OUR WEBSITE) POSES SIGNIFICANT AND SERIOUS RISKS TO YOU AND YOUR ONLINE ASSETS. THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THESE RISKS AND YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND EXCLUSIONS THAT MIGHT APPLY TO YOU AND YOUR RIGHTS. IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU READ IT CAREFULLY.


THESE TERMS REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.


BY USING THE WEBSITE OR OUR SERVICES, YOU ACCEPT AND ARE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.


YOU MAY NOT USE OUR WEBSITE OR SERVICES IF YOU: (A) DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS; (B) ARE NOT THE OLDER OF (i) AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE; OR (ii) LEGAL AGE TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT; OR (C) ARE PROHIBITED FROM ACCESSING OR USING THIS WEBSITE OR ANY OF THIS WEBSITE’S FUNCTIONALITIES BY THESE TERMS OR BY APPLICABLE LAW.


Acceptance of These Terms of Use


These terms of use are entered into by and between you (“you” or the “User”) and Trading Strategy Operations Ltd, Republic of Seychelles based International Business Company, with a registered address at Suite 102 Aarti Chambers, Mont Fleuri, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles (“Trading Strategy,” the “Trading Strategy DAO,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, these “Terms of Use” or this “Agreement”), govern the User’s access to and use of https://Tradingstrategy.ai/, and its sub-pages, including any content or functionality offered on or through the website-hosted user interface accessible via https://Tradingstrategy.ai/ (the “Interface,” or collectively with other https://Tradingstrategy.ai/ subpages, the “Website”).


The User must read these Terms of Use carefully before using the Website (including the Interface). By using the Website or the Interface, the User accepts and agrees to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use and all documents incorporated herein by reference. If the User does not want to agree to these Terms of Use or any documents that are incorporated herein by reference, the User must not access the Website or use the Interface, and discontinue all use immediately.


The Website is offered and only available to users who are eighteen (18) years of age or older. By using this Website, the User represents and warrants that the User is at least the higher of legal age to form a binding contract with Trading Strategy in the User’s applicable jurisdiction or eighteen (18) years of age, and meets all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. Further, by using this Website, the User represents and warrants that the User is not a citizen or resident of, nor is located in, any country where the use of the Website is illegal or impermissible, whether by rule, statute, regulation, bylaw, court adjudication or order, protocol, administrative statement, decree, code, or other directive, requirement or guideline, whether applicable on Trading Strategy, the Website, the Interface, the Protocol (as defined herein), or on the User (or any combination of the foregoing) by an authority with valid and enforceable jurisdiction (“Applicable Laws”). If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Website.


The Services and Protocol; Blockchain Fees.


The Website’s services (the “Services”) include without limitation providing methods and information to enable those who access the Website (“Participants”) to access to or participate in the Trading Strategy decentralized, autonomous financial market and algorithmic trading  mechanisms and strategies powered by blockchain-enforced smart contracts (the “Protocol”). The Protocol provides access to a range of quantitative algorithmic trading strategies developed by third-party strategy developers and/or Trading Strategy. Users are responsible for selecting and executing these strategies based on their own assessment of risk and suitability. The Protocol is intended to be provided and operate in a decentralized manner, meaning that Trading Strategy itself, Trading Strategy contractors, Trading Strategy employees, individual Trading Strategy contributors, developers of strategies made available on the Website, or the Protocol, and the Trading Strategy DAO, have no ability to control, modify, prevent, stop, amend, or adjust interactions or transactions after they are submitted to the Protocol, whether or not through the Interface. Further, the Interface is not the only method that individuals or parties may interact with, contribute to, access, or otherwise affect the Protocol. Thus, the Services (including the Website and the Interface) are distinct from the Protocol, and any of the Protocol’s products or offerings should not be viewed as products or offerings provided by Trading Strategy or the Website. You are expected to be familiar with the Protocol and the risks it represents (including without limitation the possibility of your crypto-assets being forfeited according to the Protocol’s rules or being lost for any other reason) before accessing it (whether accessed via the Interface or otherwise). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OR INTERACTION WITH THE PROTOCOL IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND TRADING STRATEGY WAIVES ALL LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY, AND MAKES NO WARRANTIES, RELATED TO THE PROTOCOL, WHETHER OR NOT THE PROTOCOL IS ACCESSED VIA OUR SERVICES.


Your complete use and enjoyment of the Services (whether or not by using the Interface) will likely require you to pay transactional fees required by their underlying blockchain or distributed ledger service, or by the Protocol itself, that are designed to encourage their intended use among the Protocol’s participants (“Blockchain Fees”). These Blockchain Fees are not levied directly by Trading Strategy, but rather are determined by your use of the Services and the rules placed by the corresponding Protocol and underlying blockchain communities at large. You acknowledge that Trading Strategy has no control over Blockchain Fees, (including, without limitation, their applicability, payment, amounts, transmission, transmission, intended operation, and effectiveness) whether related to your use of the Services or otherwise, and agree that in no event will Trading Strategy be responsible to you or any other part for the payment, repayment, refund, disbursement, indemnity, or for any other aspect of your use or transmission of Blockchain Fees. For further information regarding blockchain technology, crypto-assets and the associated risks, see Nature of Blockchain; Assumption of Risk; Waiver of Claims.


Accessing the Website and User Security.


We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the Website (including the Interface), and any other Services or material we provide on the Website, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website, the Interface, the Protocol, or any of the Services are unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Website, or the entire Website, to Participants.


Website, or the entire Website, to Participants. 


The User is responsible for both:


Making all arrangements necessary for the User to have access to the Website and the Services.


Ensuring that all persons who access the Website or the Services through the User’s internet connection are aware of these Terms of Use and comply with them.


To access certain Services or some of the resources offered on the Website, the User may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. Other Services or resources offered on the Website (such as the Interface) may require the User to utilize certain Web3 capabilities, such a crypto-asset wallet capable of interacting with the User’s web browser or relevant blockchain nodes (“Web3 Utilities”). It is a condition of the User’s use of the Website and the Services that the User only operates such Web3 Utilities with a private key(s) that the User created or has the direct, explicit permission of the party who created the relevant private key(s). The User agrees that all information it provides to interact with the Website, Interface, Services, or otherwise, including, but not limited to, through the use of any interactive features on the Website is correct, current, and complete. The User consents to all actions we take with respect to the User’s information as is consistent with these Terms of Use and all documents referenced or incorporated herein.


If the User utilizes a Web3 Utility that relies on a separate username, password, private key, or any other piece of information as part of its security procedures, the User must treat such information as confidential, and the User must not disclose that information to any other person or entity. The User also acknowledges that any identity linked to its Web3 Utility is personal to the User and agrees not to provide any other person with access to such identity. The User also agrees to ensure that it will lock or otherwise prevent its Web3 Utility from unauthorized use on this Website or the Services at the end of each session. The User should use particular caution when accessing the Website or the Services from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record the User’s username, password, private key, or other personal information. In the event the User’s Web3 credentials are compromised, the User acknowledges and understands that all of its related crypto-assets may be compromised as well, and waives any and all responsibility of and liability against Trading Strategy related to any losses in any such event.

However, we cannot review interactions or activities before they are executed through the Website, and, given the nature of blockchain and functionalities like those offered via the Services, cannot ensure prompt removal or rectification of objectionable interactions or activities after they have been executed. Accordingly, the User agrees that we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, transactions, blockchain operations, or content provided by any Participant or third party, including any that may cause a malfunction or inaccuracy on the Website or among the Services. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for any other party’s performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this Section, nor for any harms or damages created by others’ interactions with any blockchain underlying the Services or reliance on the information or content presented on the Website.

THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.


Nature of Blockchain; Assumption of Risk; Waiver of Claims.


Blockchains, smart contracts, Decentralized Exchanges, DEXs, DeFi, crypto-assets, the Protocol, and their related technologies and functionalities are still emerging innovations that carry an extremely high amount of foreseeable and unforeseeable risk from security, financial, technical, political, social, and personal safety standpoints. The mere access to and interaction with blockchains requires high degrees of skill and knowledge to operate with a relative degree of safety and proficiency. Crypto-assets are highly volatile in nature due to many diverse factors, including without limitation use and adoption, speculation, manipulation, technology, security, and legal and regulatory developments and application. Further, the speed and cost of transacting with cryptographic technologies, such as blockchains like those underlying the Protocol, are variable and highly volatile. Moreover, the transparent nature of many blockchains means that any interactions the User has with the Protocol and any blockchain will be publicly visible and readable in human form.


By accessing and using the Website or the Services, the User acknowledges the foregoing, and agrees and represents that it understands and assumes such and other risks involved with blockchains, DeFi, the Protocol, and related technologies (including without limitation any specific technical language used in this Agreement). The User further represents that it has all knowledge sufficient to use, and is informed of all foreseeable risks and the possibility of unforeseeable risks associated with, blockchains, crypto-assets, Web3 Utilities, smart contracts, the Interface, the Protocol, and the Services. The User further acknowledges, and assumes all risk related to the possibility, that any information presented via the Website, Interface, the Protocol, or Services may be inaccurate, possibly due to another party’s malicious activities and possibly to the User’s severe harm or detriment. The User agrees that we are not responsible for any of these or related risks, do not own or control any blockchain and that the Protocol itself is managed by a dispersed group of individual contributors who cannot guarantee the safe or accurate functioning of the Services, and shall not be held liable for any resulting harms, damages, or losses incurred by or against the User experiences while accessing or using the Website or the Services. Accordingly, the User acknowledges the foregoing, represents its understanding of the foregoing, and agrees to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Website, the Protocol, and interacting with the Services, whether mentioned in this Section or otherwise. The User further expressly waives and releases us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to the User’s use of the Website and the User’s interaction with the Services.


No Provision of Professional Advice.


All information or content provided or displayed by the Website (including, without limitation, on the Interface) is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as professional advice (including, without limitation, tax, legal, technical, or financial advice). The User should not take or refrain from taking any action based on any information or content displayed or provided on the Website, the Protocol, on the Interface, or through the Services. The User should seek independent professional advice from an individual licensed and competent in the appropriate area before the User makes any financial, legal, or other decisions where such should be considered prudent. The User acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permissible by law, it has not relied on Trading Strategy, the content on the Website, the Interface, the Protocol, or the Services for any professional advice related to its financial or legal behaviors.


No Fiduciary Duties.


These Terms of Use, and the provision of the Website, the Interface, the Protocol, and the Services, are not intended to create any fiduciary duties between us and the User or any third party. Individual Trading Strategy contributors, Trading Strategy and its affiliates, employees, contractors, directors, founders, strategy developers, licensees, and licensors never take possession, custody, control, ownership, or management of any crypto-assets or other property transmitted via the Interface. To the fullest extent permissible by law, the User agrees that neither the User’s use of the Website, the Interface, the Protocol, or the Services causes us or any Participant to owe fiduciary duties or liabilities to the User or any third party. Further, the User acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent available under Applicable Law, such duties or liabilities are afforded by law or by equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated, and that we and any other Participant shall be held completely harmless in relation thereof. The User further agrees that the only duties and obligations that we or any contributor owes the User, and the only rights the User has related to this Agreement or the User’s use of the Website or the Services, are those set out expressly in this Agreement or that cannot be waived by law. Further, the User agrees and understands that they are solely responsible for all applicable reporting requirements and deadlines, including taxes and relevant fees, and that we owe Users no affirmative duties with respect to said reporting requirements and deadlines.


No Insurance.


Your crypto accounts are not traditional financial accounts, and are definitely not checking or savings accounts. We do not provide any kind of insurance to you against any type of loss, including (without limitation) losses due to decrease in value of assets, assets lost due to a cybersecurity failure, or from your or other individuals’ errors or malfeasance. In many jurisdictions crypto-assets are not considered legal tender, and most crypto-assets are not backed by any government. Neither your crypto-asset balances nor any of your transactions via the Interface or Protocol are covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”), or other similar protections in any jurisdiction, anywhere. There is a very strong likelihood that you may lose meaningful portions, if not all of the value of your contributed assets, without any recourse whatsoever.

Governing Law and Jurisdiction.


All matters relating to the Website and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of Seychelles without giving effect to any law or rule that would cause the application of another jurisdiction’s law (whether of Seychelles, or any other jurisdiction).


Arbitration; Class Arbitration Waiver.


Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the User’s use of the Website, the Protocol, the Interface, or the Services, or in connection with this Agreement, including disputes arising from or concerning their interpretation, violation, invalidity, non-performance, or termination, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution under its applicable Arbitration Rules. A single arbitrator shall preside, and proceedings shall be conducted remotely to the maximum extent possible. Each Party shall pay its own expenses in such arbitration, including its attorneys’ fees, subject to reapportionment by the arbitrator in a final award. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred in such proceeding in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled. Any interim or provisional relief that would be available from a court of law shall be available in accordance with the rules of ICDR, however, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Parties from obtaining preliminary injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, if necessary to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any arbitration. The final arbitration award may be confirmed in a court of competent jurisdiction, and the Parties agree to waive any claim of improper venue or forum non conveniens. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties. The tribunal shall have the power to rule on any challenge to its own jurisdiction or to the validity or enforceability of any portion of the agreement to arbitrate. The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and that these Terms of Use do not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. In the event the prohibition on class arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then its remaining portions will remain in force.

Waiver and Severability.


No waiver by Trading Strategy of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Trading Strategy to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.
