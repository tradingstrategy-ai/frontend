# Instructions to work with the code base

## English

- Use UK/British English instead of US English: Say things like `visualise` instead of `visualize`
- For headings, only capitalise the first letter of heading, do not use title case

## Adding and updating components and pages

- When you create or update a Svelte component or page in `src/lib` or `src/routes`, include a comment at the beginning of the module on the purpose of the component and where it is being used

## Function docstrings

- All functions added or edited should include minimal one-line code comment describing the purpose of a function

## Javascript package manager and package scripts

Use `pnpm` instead of `npm`.

## Formatting code

Run:

```
pnpm run format
```
